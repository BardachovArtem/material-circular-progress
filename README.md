# Material circular indicator

A circular indeterminate progress... circle? Anyway, based off of [Google's Material Design specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators). Not particularly friendly for use by other people, but it looks nice.

It was done purely using CSS and SVG (using LESS, though it was originally CSS).
